        <h3>So... who is Milky? </h3>
        <p>With a background in literature, art and social sciences, Milky decided to take a 360¬∫ turn and land into the tech world. What fuels Milky's rocket?</p>
        <h4>Learning</h4>
        <img src="/resources/img/learn.png" width="300px" alt="">
        <p>I am in love with learning (the story of how I became such a big reader).</p>
        <h4>Creativity</h4>
        <img src="/resources/img/creativity.png" width="300px" alt="">
        <p>I'm also a creative human that enjoys developing and innovating new ideas, fresh and that actually provide value. Be yourself, the others are taken</p>
        <h4>Supportive</h4>
        <img src="/resources/img/Captura de pantalla 2022-11-12 a las 9.17.03.png" width= 300px alt="">
        <p>I love to encourage and spread positivity, help others become the best version of themselves, uplifting and creating positive experiences for everyone to be included. I believe your success is also my success.</p>
        <h4>Excellence</h4>
        <img src="/resources/img/work.png" width="300px" alt="">
        <p>I believe in excellence and I give the best of myself in what I do, it doesn‚Äôt matter what you do but how you do it, and I do it with dedication, honesty, hard work and proud. </p>
        <h4>Humanity</h4>
        <img src="/resources/img/humanity.png" width="300px" alt="">
        <p>I believe that work is interconnected with humanity in the sense that our work has to go towards taking care and protecting humans, and all life in this planet. We must commit our precious time in the Earth to protect and cheer it, go with it and not against it. </p>
        <h4>Resilience</h4>
        <img src="/resources/img/resilience.png" width="300px" alt="">
        <p>I believe in the power of resilience, on failing and trying again, becoming stronger facing new challenges, embracing the reality of a always-changing environment. Life is change, I embrace it and I‚Äôm ready to sail that boat.</p>

            <h5>A platform game built with JavaScript and Phaser.js</h5>
            <p>A platform game with a POC female protagonist. Seeing the lack of representation of POC woman as protagonists on video games. Called by those who played it the ‚ÄúDark Souls‚Äù of the platform games, it shows a level of difficulty that keeps you motivated to reach the end of the level.</p>
